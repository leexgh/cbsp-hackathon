# Visualization by Mutation Mapper
[Mutation Mapper](https://www.cbioportal.org/mutation_mapper) maps mutations on a linear protein and its domains (lollipop plots). We have online Mutation Mapper tool available on [cBioPortal](https://www.cbioportal.org/mutation_mapper).

Mutation Mapper accepts tab-delimited or space-delimited mutation data as input, and should at least have the genomic location headers in the first line for a successful annotation. 

- Chromosome
- Start_Position
- End_Position
- Reference_Allele
- Variant_Allele
