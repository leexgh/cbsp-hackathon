# Recreate simplified version of Oncoprint
[Oncoprint](https://www.cbioportal.org/oncoprinter) are compact means of visualizing distinct genomic alterations, including somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and mRNA expression changes across a set of cases. They are extremely useful for visualizing gene set and pathway alterations across a set of cases, and for visually identifying trends, such as trends in mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence between gene pairs within a gene set. Individual genes are represented as rows, and individual cases or patients are represented as columns. We have online Oncoprint tool available on [cBioPortal](https://www.cbioportal.org/oncoprinter).
